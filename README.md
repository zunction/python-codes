## python codes in here
- newmd.py



creates a new markdown file for a new post in pelican using the command:
```python
python newmd.py 'title of pelican post'
```


- whatsappwordcloud.py

takes in a whatsapp chat obtained from the whatsapp email chat function, cleans the whatsapp chat data and produces a wordcloud of it. Requires `wordcloud` `matplotlib` `pil` package. 

Need to improve on its functionality of recognising names of friends.
```python
whatsappwordcloud.py *name_of_text_file*
```
